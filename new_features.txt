New features:

1) PRIORITY TASK
Added ability to prioritize a task. The resulting item has "!!! IMPORTANT !!!" appended to the end of the task and capitalizing task. Also added the ability to remove the priority status.

Methods in TodoList Class
	prioritize_item(item_id)
	normalize_item(item_id)

Methods in Item Class
	make_prioirty
	remove_priority
	priority?


2) DUE DATE
Added ability to add a due date to the item. Needs to be put in as a string in a yy-mm-dd format. Will output in the todo list as "Due Date: <date>".

Methods in TodoList Class
	add_due_date(item_id, due_date)
	remove_due_date(item_id)

Methods in Item Class
	set_due_Date(due_date)
	remove_date
	is_date_set?


3) MENU CLASS
Created a new class, "Menu", that is in menu.rb. This class allows the user to select options using a menu. (It uses a "clear" screen command that works on my Mac terminal...I also have a "cls" command that is SUPPOSED to work on Window's terminals, per Stack Overflow, but I am unable to test it).

To start the menu'd version, you can create a ruby file in the same folder as todolist.rb and add the text below to the file:

require_relative "menu"
menu = Menu.new
menu.print_menu

Or you can start irb and type in:
load "menu.rb"
menu = Menu.new
menu.print_menu

There is a major bug to work out with it...it assumes you actually enter an integer when you are asked...not a string. But, if you follow the instructions, it works (...on a Mac)!
